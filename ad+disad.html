                        not just read the text from a textbook or PowerPoint.<br><br>Let’s take biology lessons as an example, it is easier for students to explore the world 
                        of anatomy instead of providing the body in real life, which is inconvenient. Virtual Reality enables the students to observe it in detail with 
                        impressive visualization. Thus, it creates interest for them, they are motivated to learn more by themselves.<br><br>Another advantage is that 
                        Virtual Reality can change how we communicate. We used to communicate by talking to each other, but it created a language barrier for some of us. 
                        Virtual Reality solves this problem since it provides another way to express ourselves by using graphics representation or even body language, 
                        so that we can create our Virtual Reality model. </p>

                        Besides, Virtual Reality creates a realistic virtual world, which may cause users to become addicted to it and affects their daily routine. 
                        Hence, it weakens their communication skills in real life due to the differences between how we react to others in the virtual world and reality.<br><br>
                        Furthermore, some may find it’s uncomfortable or even sick to wear the VR headset because of how our brains process the image and animation.
                        Despite how real the objects look in the virtual world, it still has their flaws.<br><br>Therefore, it cannot replace the actual object in our world. 
                        After all, Virtual Reality is just a tool to assist humans. </p>
